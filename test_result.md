# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "You are an expert in text-to-speech (TTS) systems and user interface design. I want to improve the current audio generation feature by allowing users to choose from different voice options before generating speech audio from the script. After the script is generated, and before generating the audio, the system should prompt the user to select from multiple voice options (e.g., male, female, robotic, various accents). The selection should be presented through a dropdown menu or modal interface with clear labels (e.g., \"Male – US\", \"Female – UK\"). Once a voice is selected, the system should generate the audio using that specific voice model. Replace the current default male voice setup with a flexible voice engine that supports multiple voices. Use a free TTS engine with voice support like Edge-TTS."

Successfully verified ALL timestamp formats are properly removed from TTS audio: 1) Format with spaces '(0:30 - 0:45)' generates 28,224 chars clean audio ✅, 2) Format without spaces '(0:00-0:03)' generates 22,464 chars clean audio ✅, 3) Mixed formats in same text generates 42,624 chars clean audio ✅, 4) Different dash types (hyphen/en-dash) both work correctly ✅, 5) Multiple timestamps per line properly cleaned ✅, 6) Timestamps at any position in text removed ✅. Comprehensive script testing with complex video script generates 446,784 chars of clean audio with ALL production elements removed (timestamps, scene descriptions, speaker directions, metadata). TTS audio generation working excellently with Edge-TTS producing high-quality base64 audio across 8 curated voices. Voice selection provides proper gender/language variety (Male/Female, US/UK/Australian/Canadian). Complete integration flow (script generation → voice selection → audio generation) operates seamlessly. Error handling robust for all edge cases. The timestamp filtering fix is production-ready and completely resolves the reported issue where timestamps were being spoken in generated audio."

      message: "FIXED SCRIPT FILTERING FOR PRODUCTION ELEMENTS: User reported that the voice was speaking timestamps like '(0:03)', speaker directions like '(Expert)', and production notes like '**(VISUAL CUE:**' in generated audio. Enhanced the extract_clean_script function with comprehensive filtering patterns to remove: 1) Single timestamps (0:00) and timestamp ranges (0:00-0:03), 2) All speaker directions including (Expert), (Voiceover), (Person Speaking), 3) Visual/sound cues **(VISUAL CUE:**, **(SOUND:**, 4) Scene descriptions **[SCENE]**, 5) Metadata sections like **Key Considerations**. Function now uses improved regex patterns and comprehensive filtering to ensure ONLY actual spoken dialogue is included in audio generation."
